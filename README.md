# pySortingAlgoVizualisator
python .exe app that visualizes a few sorrting algorithms


the application is quite straightforward. You just launch the .exe and it works (supposedly correctly)

IN ORDER TO GET TO THE .EXE FILE:
  1) open "PyCharmMiscProject" folder
  2) open "dist" folder
  3) open "Визуализатор Алгоритмов Сортировки".

Using the .exe is also far from complicated. Use buttons and sliders to adjust the animation, array size; to choose the sorting algorithm.
